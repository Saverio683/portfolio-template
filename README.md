# Getting Started 

In the project directory, you can run `yarn` or `npm install` to install all libraries.

You have to get your free **[Emailjs](https://www.emailjs.com/)** account and you must enter your details in the [EmailForm](https://github.com/Saverio683/portfolio-template/blob/main/src/components/email-form/email-form.component.jsx) component and in the [Index.html](https://github.com/Saverio683/portfolio-template/blob/main/public/index.html). Make sure that the input tag *parameters* of the EmailForm component are the same as the environment variables of your email template.

If you want to insert your resume, place it in the **_public_** path.

To enter your personal information (about me, my projects etc ...) just add them in the [datas.js](https://github.com/Saverio683/portfolio-template/blob/main/src/assets/datas.js) file and that's it! (except for the strings on the home page which must be changed in the appropriate component) And in the [assets](https://github.com/Saverio683/portfolio-template/tree/main/src/assets) folder there are already several icons of programming languages and social networks ready to use.

*If you liked the project, please leave a star, thank you :)*
